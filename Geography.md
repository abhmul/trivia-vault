# Geography
## Principles
### Interests
1. Want to have (1) geospatial, (2) historical and international relationship (3) fiscal (4) climate (5) superlative familiarity with countries around the world  
2. Want to have ^ relavant familiarities for major cities, landmarks, and natural regions (e.g. mountain ranges, seas, natural reserves, desserts, forests, lakes, and rivers).  
  
### Strategies 
1. Break down large regions and groups of countries into subregions (e.g. Caribbean -> Greater, Lesser Antilles)  
2. Learn information about these countries to help relate them to each other and better remember their characteristics and location.  
  
### Obsidian Vault Design
1. Different map regions, countries, and cities have individual notes. These are linked to each other in *parent-child* relationships.  
2. Other entities described in *interests* also have individual notes. They are linked to other countries and regions they intersect.  
3. Notes are populated with information about each place.  
4. Vault can be built incrementally by focusing on one region and building it out.

## Different regions
1. [[Caribbean Islands]]
2. [[Oceania]]
