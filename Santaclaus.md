This holidank season, we are giving you someone new to add to the festive spirit mascots. Krampus? He's a grump! Old Dank Nic? Sure, he's nice but more like a stoned Uncle. There's a new homie on these streets and he goes by Santanaclaus! And for his signature blend, we went straight for comfort. 

A base of clean, sweet Catuai Washed from Finca San Jeronimo is blended with a washed coffee from Nayarit, Mexico, layering additional sweetness and baking spice. With notes of fudge, cinnamon sticks, and pistachio, you'll want to make friends with Santanaclaus STAT!
